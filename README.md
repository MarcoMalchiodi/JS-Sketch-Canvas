# JS-Sketch-Canvas
This is a small project to test flex properties and Javascript applied to HTML.
The flex container is a 16x16 canvas containing 256 yellow squares that can be "painted" in red. Whenever the mouse hovers over a yellow square, it momentarily turns red. Clicking on a yellow square turns it red, whereas the opposite is also true.
All divs, with the 'container' being the oly exception, are created by JS for loops.
